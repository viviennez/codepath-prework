# Tip calculator

This is a pre-work for codepath ios for designer bootcamp. The project is done in Xcode using swift for iPhone 5.

How many hours did it take to complete?
 * About 2 hours - I was playing around with the configuration and animation.

Completed user stories:

 * Required - basic tip calculator as shown in the tutorial video - user can input a number and get results of the tip and the total amount based on the percentage selection.
 * Optional - some of the view colors are changed, use a custom font of Helvetica Neue, add an app icon, add an animated image (by clicking the user name).
